# DES_Automated_Factory
This repository contains the code of a discrete events simulator for an automated factory, developed as a final project
for the Simulation course, held at the University of Turin by Professor Gianfranco Balbo, in the academic year 2024/2025.

# Description

The aim of the project was the development of a simulator to compute and analyse some performance
indicators (e.g. cycle time) of an automated production plant.
After developing a queue model, MVA analysis was applied to obtain a numerical estimate of 
the quantities of interest for a simplified version of the model.
Later, a discrete events simulator, written in C++, was developed to obtain estimates for
the full model and compare them with what was obtained with MVA.

Overall, this allowed me to practice the implementation of a full pipeline for the evaluation of performance
of a system that can be modelled as queue network.
More details can be found in the final report present in this repository.
